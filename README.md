# Source Code of AAAI22-2171

## Introduction

The source code includes training and inference procedures for the proposed method of the paper submitted to the Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2022) with title "**Shape-Adaptive Selection and Measurement for Oriented Object Detection**" (ID: 2171).

The the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on two baseline methods. Corresponding source code and configurations reside in following two sub-directories:

* ``sasm_reppoints``: the implementation and verification using [RepPoints](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9009032) as baseline;
* ``sasm_s2anet``: the implementation and verification using [S$^2$A-Net](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377550) as baseline.

We provide only the source code related to the proposed method in the sub-directories so that reviewers can check them quickly and conveniently.

Please refer to the ``README.md`` file in each sub-directory for the detailed instructions of usage.
